Inventory Manager – Price Calculation Issue
In the Inventory Manager, I noticed that the Edit/Delete functions are working now, which is great. However, there is an issue with how product pricing is handled. When I add a product like "Paracetamol" with a quantity of 100 and the unit as "Strip", I want to enter the price per strip (for example, ₹50 per strip). But the system currently does not calculate the total value. It should automatically multiply the unit price by quantity — in this case, ₹50 × 100 = ₹5000 — and also include GST if applicable.

Required Calculation Logic
The inventory system should be able to handle units like Strip, Kg, Gram, Litre, Unit, Dozen, etc. The logic should be: I enter the price of one unit, and the system should automatically calculate the total value = quantity × unit price, and display the final amount (with or without GST as needed). This is essential for proper stock valuation and billing.

POS (Point of Sale) – Same Issue
This same logic is also missing from the Point of Sale (POS) screen. When I select a product from the dropdown and add it to the cart, I am not able to enter how many units I want to sell. There is no option to change quantity or price. Once a product is in the cart, there is no way to edit or delete it either, which makes corrections impossible.

Expected POS Functionality
In the POS, after selecting a product, I should be able to:

1. Enter the quantity to sell,


2. Automatically apply the correct unit price from inventory,


3. Calculate and display the total amount (unit price × quantity),


4. Optionally show GST,


5. Edit or delete any item from the cart if needed.



Summary
To summarize, both the Inventory Manager and POS need to support proper unit-wise pricing and total calculation. Basic features like quantity input, unit price handling, total price calculation, and edit/delete options in the cart are essential for smooth operation. Once these are working correctly, I will continue testing and share further feedback.
